If you wanna leave New Jersey
There's a toll you'll have to pay
But it'll cost you more than that
If you want to stay
There's something in the air
Cause geniuses live there

[chorus]
Einstein and Edison
Springsteen and me x 2

If you're from New Jersey
well you're gonna have to be
content with 201 or 609 or 973
But if you're feeling blue
Cause you don't have 212

[chorus]
Think of Einstein and Edison
Springsteen and me x 2

Be nice to New Jersey
Our tomatoes are the best
We're God's chosen people
She sure puts us to the test
But there's something in the air
Cause the girls all have big hair
So did Einstein so be kind to New Jersey, yeah!
